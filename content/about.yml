  Hi, I'm **Carlos Alvarez**, a Senior Software Engineer based in Saint Johns, Florida. For more than a decade, I've worked across the full spectrum of web development, most recently focusing on Magento, PHP, and large-scale eCommerce architectures.

  My career has taken me from embedded systems and internal tooling to leading major features and international expansions for enterprise-level Magento platforms. Most recently at **Material Bank**, I developed and shipped end-to-end features, architected custom modules, integrated ERPs and third-party APIs, and played a key role in launching the company's Japanese market implementation.

  ### My Engineering Philosophy

  I approach software with a mindset centered around **clarity, reliability, and continuous improvement**. Good engineering solves real problems, reduces friction, and scales without drama. Whether I'm building custom Magento modules, improving developer workflows, or integrating complex systems, my goal is always the same: create solutions that make life easier for both users and the teams who maintain them.

  I value clean architecture, thoughtful communication, and processes that empower teams to move quickly without breaking things. I believe great engineering and good leadership come from empathy, curiosity, and the willingness to iterate.

  ### What Drives Me

  I love taking complex problems, from performance issues to cross-system integrations, and breaking them into simple, maintainable solutions. Seeing a feature go from idea to production, knowing it's stable, scalable, and genuinely useful, is what keeps me motivated.

  Continuous learning is a big part of who I am. Whether it's mastering new backend patterns, improving CI/CD pipelines, or exploring better ways to serve customers through automation and tooling, I'm always looking for the next challenge that helps me grow.

  ### Beyond the Code

  Outside of engineering, I'm a dad, a maker, and someone who's always tinkering, whether it's 3D printing, improving my home server setup, or experimenting with side projects like a minimalistic CRM for solopreneurs or AI-powered assistants for small businesses.

  Thanks for visiting.
