  Hi, I'm **Sahudy Sharolyn Soriano**, an Industrial Engineer and Project Lead based in Saint Johns, Florida. For more than 10 years, I've led projects across manufacturing, logistics, operations, and financial consulting, always driven by a focus on efficiency, customer satisfaction, and measurable impact.

  My career began in high-demand industrial environments, where I learned firsthand the power of Lean methodologies, smart process design, and data-driven decision making. Since then, I've guided companies through operational improvements, implemented Agile frameworks, managed financial workflows, and optimized supply chain processes. In every role, my focus has been the same: transform complexity into efficiency.

  ### My Leadership & Project Philosophy

  My approach is rooted in **clarity, continuous improvement, and empathy**. Real results come from well-structured processes, motivated teams, and a mindset of iteration rather than perfection. I apply Agile, Lean, Scrum, 5S, and JIT practices not as buzzwords, but as frameworks to reduce waste, increase productivity, and empower teams to perform at their best.

  Whether I'm re-engineering internal workflows, analyzing KPIs, or leading digital transformation initiatives, I put people at the center of the solution. Tools like SAP, Jira, and Business Intelligence platforms help scale results but it's communication, accountability, and ownership that sustain them.

  ### What Drives Me

  I'm energized by challenges where operations and strategy meet. Turning disorganized processes into well-run systems, elevating team performance, and helping businesses unlock profitability are the projects that inspire me most.

  I believe growth comes from learning, and I continue to invest in myself, currently pursuing advanced studies in Business Intelligence and Digital Project Management to expand the impact I can create.

  ### Beyond the Office

  Outside of work, I'm a hands-on learner and a mentor at heart. I enjoy supporting individuals and small businesses through financial planning, organization, and process improvements. I also love meaningful connections, traveling, and exploring new places with my family.

  Thank you for stopping by. Feel free to explore my journey further or connect with me if you'd like to collaborate or discuss how we can build something exceptional together.
